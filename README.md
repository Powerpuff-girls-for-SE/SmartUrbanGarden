# SmartUrbanGarden
Smart Urban Garden is a project that leverages the power of IoT to nurture plants within indoor settings. This system aims to streamline gardening efforts by automating essential tasks, conserving water, and ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth. We create an automated ecosystem that employs sensors for monitoring crucial plant parameters such as temperatureÔ∏è, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture.  The primary objective of this system is to significantly reduce manual intervention, enhancing convenience while fostering an ideal environment for plant growth. By continuously storing essential plant data in a relational database, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, users gain insights into the conditions necessary for optimal plant health.
This system operates on a processing unit which collect data from various sensors and control actuators. These values will then be displayed on a web dashboard which allows users to know the environmental conditions of the plants when they check on them. The smart urban garden will be divided into areas in which the user can have different plants and conditions for the optimal growth and maintenance of the plant.
